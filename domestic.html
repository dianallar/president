                    <h3>1. Worker's Bill of Rights</h3>
                    <p>Our workers are the backbone of this nation and all that it stands for. We need a premier standard of labor to supplement their continued efforts. The most important thing we can guarantee is a fairer standard of work, which is why, as Governor of Montana, I signed legislation to ban mandatory arbitration, implemented a right to disconnect from workplace communications outside of working hours, a ban on forcing non-disclosure agreements to cover up poor workplace conduct, and increased the minimum wage.</p>
                    <p>We need to implement these policies - And go further - At the federal level. They've worked in Montana. It's time to ensure that every worker has predictable scheduling, the right to collective bargaining, a fair wage, proper workplace conduct, and aren't pressured into signing contracts to protect a company by their superiors. I am proud to support the American workforce as they keep this country great, from the rust belt cities of Michigan and Wisconsin to agricultural workers in California and Kansas.</p>

                    <h3>2. Universal Preschool</h3>
                    <p>Raising a child shouldn't be a struggle. An Allar Administration would support new parents by making it easier for Americans to access an early, inexpensive, educational standard of childcare for their kids. Education shouldnâ€™t be a privilege that starts at five, itâ€™s a right that begins at three. Our Universal Preschool plan will:</p>
                        <li>
                            Provide free, high-quality pre-K for every child, staffed by well-paid educators with accredited curricula.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Partner with existing childcare centers and public schools to scale quickly, prioritizing underserved areas first.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Include wraparound services like nutrition programs and developmental screenings to set kids up for success.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>Study after study shows preschool pays for itself: It boosts graduation rates, reduces future special education costs, makes employment and college graduation likelier later on, improves social motor skills for those who have attended preschool and are entering grade school, and delivers $7-$12 in long-term benefits for every $1 invested. Weâ€™ll fund this through the Windfall Tax (See: Economic Policy).</p>

                    <h3>3. Reproductive Freedom</h3>
                    <p>Abortion is healthcare. Period. It's a choice that any pregnant woman should be able to make for herself. Weâ€™ll do what President Schuyler didn't and codify the right to choose nationwide, increasing from the 18-week nationwide minimum with legislation that:
                        <li>
                        Protects abortion access until and after fetal viability (and beyond for health risks), with no forced waiting periods or medically unnecessary restrictions. You aren't truly pro choice if you don't support the choice at any point in time, abandoning the principle at an arbitrary point chosen by the government.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Shields providers and patients from violence by making planned parenthoods gun-free zones, and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Expands Medicaid coverage for reproductive care, including contraception and IVF, because freedom means access, not just legal technicality.
                        </li>

                    <h3>4. National Parks in Every State</h3>
                    <p>Nature is one of America's most vital assets. From the beautiful forests and mountains of Appalachia to the redwoods of California to the Everglades of Florida, America's public lands are its common heritage. Yet, ~20 states lack a national park. Here's a promise: by the end of an Allar Administration, there will be one national park in every state. Here are some primary targets:
                        <li>
                        ðŸ‘‰ Adirondack Mountains, New York
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        ðŸ‘‰ Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        ðŸ‘‰ Ancient Mounds, Ohio
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>We also need to ensure that we are conserving these lands instead of actively destroying them. An Allar Administration will ban new drilling and mining licenses on public lands and divest federal funding towards cleaning up polluted areas in national and state parks alike, such as the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.</p>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>5. Infrastructure for People, Not Cars</h3>
                    <p>Our Complete Streets Initiative will redesign roads to prioritize walking, biking, and transit; Saving lives, cutting emissions, and reconnecting communities. Weâ€™ll:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mandate sidewalks, bike lanes, and bus/streetcar lanes in all federally funded projects.</li>
                            <li>Spend federal money on redesigning hundreds of thousands of road miles to be suitable for walking, biking, and busing.</li>
                            <li>Replace every lead pipe in America within 5 years, using emergency funds and union labor, because clean water isnâ€™t negotiable. In what is, with no doubt, the greatest nation on the face of this planet, no person should have unsafe drinking water.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, our Public Transit Expansion will:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Triple funding for light rail and electric buses, with free fares for low-income riders.</li>
                            <li>Restore Amtrak routes gutted since the 1970s, focusing on "flyover country" first.</li>
                            <li>Hopefully, collaborate with countries across North and South America to begin development of a hemispheric regional connector network.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The average household spends $10,000/year on car ownershipâ€”It's time to give ourselves better options, because we deserve better.</p>

                    <h3>6. Better Park Planning</h3>
                   <p>Everyone loves parks! We have so many beautiful plots of land in various locations in the United States, and while the scenery is phenomenal on its own, parks should be far more than just land plots, and there should be a lot more of them. Under an Allar Administration, we will: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish a bureau of recreational planning, to partner with state governments and create a better standard for our parks, their preservation, and their purpose;</li>
                            <li>Begin funding the creation of more recreational centers, independent restaurants, and bookstores/libraries in parks;</li>
                            <li>Use conjoined abandoned lots acquired by eminent domain or unused federal land to construct new parks.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>There's nothing more relaxing than looking out on Maggie Valley, North Carolina with a cup of coffee and a book in hand. We'll make this a feasible reality for every American.</p>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>7. Bureau of American Expression</h3>
                    <p>One of the most important pillars of American society is its emphasis on multicultural expression. Arts, music, theater, traditional clothing, literature, whatever it may be, it's important to us as a country to celebrate the various cultures that have come together and melted down in one big pot. Unfortunately, as society becomes more homogenic, and many cultures are shunned, we may lose sight on one of the most important facets of America: its culture, or, instead, its lack thereof. America's vast variety of cultures is one of its most important features. We need to protect this. An Allar Administration will:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish a bureau of American Expression, Arts, Entertainment, and Culture, for the promotion and preservation of various cultural activities across the United States;</li>
                            <li>Divert federal funding towards the establishment of more Arts Centers in urban areas, including but not limited to: Chicago, San Francisco, Charlotte, New York City, the District of Columbia and Philadelphia;</li>
                            <li>Promote engagement in local activities such as music festivals, movie screenings, school plays, poetry nights, and book clubs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>One thing that is important equally to every person in this country is their idea of culture. What they hold true to them and what they believe constitutes their cultural identity. An Allar Administration will support and defend the liberal arts, indigenous cultures, BIPOC cultures, and any others, as they all matter just the same in building the type of network we have here in the United States.</p>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>8. Federal 15% Wage Subsidies For Teachers</h3>
                    <p>Teachers give their all to this nation and its children, it's time to start giving back. Teachers are the backbone of this nation's education system. It's unfair that they are subjected to poor working conditions out of their own fruition and we expect them to just keep providing for us while we use them for their labor. Let's stop treating teachers as though they are expendable and actually pay them what they are worth.</p>
                    <p>Under an Allar Administration, the federal government will implement a permanent 15% wage subsidy for all public Kâ€“12 teachers, ensuring their salaries reflect the value of their work and helping states compete for high-quality educators. This wage boost will be funded directly from federal revenues, bypassing state budget bottlenecks that have historically kept teacher pay stagnant. In addition, teachers with federal student loans will receive full forgiveness after five years of public school service, retroactive to current educators. These measures aim to reverse the teacher shortage crisis, increase retention, and recognize the essential role of educators in maintaining a strong democracy.</p>

                    <h3>9. Codification of the Equal Rights Amendment</h3>
                    <p>It's time to win the fight for women's rights. The Equal Rights Amendment made it through the penultimate stage of ratification in 1972, and yet we have yet to see it in our constitution about 83 years later. This is an unacceptable injustice for our vast community of strong, capable women all across America who have been fighting for equal representation amongst our society's social network for hundreds of years.</p>
                    <p>Under an Allar Administration the Equal Rights Amendment, which guarantees equality of rights under the law regardless of sex, will be formally codified into the U.S. Constitution. We will work with Congress to remove procedural roadblocks, recognize its ratification by the states, and enshrine it in federal law. Once codified, the ERA will serve as a permanent legal safeguard against discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity, providing a stronger foundation for court rulings and federal protections in employment, housing, education, and public life.</p>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>10. Sensible Immigration Reform</h3>
                    <p>The concept of Immigration is the backbone of America and has been for hundreds of years. People have come from near, far, or wherever they are to experience the American dream and take part in the New World Project. There is no reason to shun those who wish to come to America to experience the same and contribute meaningfully to our vast, beautiful society. Of course, the process of immigration must be legal on the part of immigrants, but it also must be humane, responsible on our part, and accessible. People from all across the world should be encouraged to come to the United States, live their lives, and raise their families.</p>
                    <p>Our immigration policy will prioritize both compassion and economic need. Dreamers, agricultural workers, and other essential laborers will be granted immediate legal status, with an eight-year pathway to citizenship for all undocumented residents who pass security checks and meet work or educational requirements. A vocational fast-track will streamline legal immigration for in-demand trades and skilled labor. Border security will be enhanced through modern surveillance and technology, replacing ineffective and harmful physical barriers; the unfinished wall will be dismantled. A federal Anti-Cartel Task Force will target criminal smuggling networks, while ICE workplace raids, often disruptive, violent and unjust, will be banned. The program will expand H-2B visas for seasonal work and create whistleblower visas for those exposing exploitation or corruption. We are also going to suspend the immediate removal of undocumented immigrants from the country upon discovery and subject them to extensive background checking before discerning whether or not they may continue to reside in the United States and engage in the eight-year PTC.

                    <h3>11. Ban Home Ownership Associations</h3>
                    <p>HOAs too often function as unaccountable private governments, imposing restrictive rules, levying excessive fines, and displacing residents. We will abolish all HOAsâ€™ legal authority to regulate private property beyond basic municipal code, effectively eliminating them as governing entities. Existing HOA-controlled developments will transition to resident-led neighborhood associations without legal enforcement powers. This will protect property rights, prevent abuse, and restore democratic accountability to local governance.</p>

                    <p>Rail infrastructure is a public good and should be managed for the benefit of communities, not private shareholders. Under an Allar Administration, we will repeal the federal law that allowed privatization of major freight and passenger rail assets, restoring public control over key routes and infrastructure. Re-nationalized rail operations will prioritize safety, environmental sustainability, and expanded passenger service, particularly hemispheric high-speed and regional commuter lines, while ensuring freight transport remains efficient and affordable for U.S. industry.</p>

                    <p>In no world should a young mother be isolated from her community by her government. Disallowing young mothers from taking breaks from school to take care of a baby that the Republicans wish to force upon them is not only hypocritical and antithetical to the purpose of being "pro-life", but it also will lead to these children the Republicans claim to care about to face harsh societal conditions as a result of the mothers opting to take care of their child before all other priorities - Which is what the Republicans claim they want the mother to do.</p>
                    <p>A Rumper Administration will support and defend NH-Budd, as they've said in their platform. An Allar Administration won't, because a woman's right to choose to raise <b>her</b> child, pursue <b>her</b> education, or terminate <b>her</b> pregnancy should not determine <b>her</b> benefits eligibility. As President, Diana Allar will repeal Section 4 of the NH-Budd Welfare Reform Act and stop letting the Republicans punish women for doing what the Republicans want them to do. It's time to stop letting hypocritical, manufactured issues control the way the wind blows in this country.</p>

                    <h3>14. National Use-Of-Force Standard for Police</h3>
                    <p>We, as a country, have struggled with police brutality plaguing our society for hundreds of years. From the Tulsa Massacre to more individual cases of the senseless murder of black citizens out of an implicit racial prejudice, to the abuse of women in public and in private out of a sense of authority, it's been apparent for a long time that our police force requires reform to carry out its modern purpose: Keeping our country safe at a municipal level.</p>
                    <p>Under an Allar Administration, we will establish a binding nationwide standard governing the use of force by law enforcement. This standard will prohibit chokeholds, require de-escalation before the use of deadly force, mandate proportionality, and require officers to intervene when witnessing misconduct. Compliance will be tied to federal law enforcement grants, ensuring adoption across all jurisdictions. The standard will also include transparent reporting requirements to track and publicly disclose use-of-force incidents.</p>

                    <p>One of our strongest commitments is that the Pentagonâ€™s 1033 program, which supplies military-grade equipment to civilian police departments, will be terminated. Local police will no longer have access to surplus armored vehicles, grenade launchers, and other battlefield weaponry. Exceptions will only be made for specialized bomb disposal equipment and certain non-lethal tools used for disaster relief.

                    <h3>16. Ending Mandatory Minimums for Nonviolent Offenses</h3>
                    <p>Mandatory minimum sentencing laws for nonviolent offenses, particularly in drug cases, will be repealed under an Allar Administration. Judges will regain discretion to issue sentences proportionate to the circumstances of each case, with a focus on rehabilitation and restorative justice rather than automatic incarceration. This reform will significantly reduce prison overcrowding, lower recidivism, lower taxpayer costs, and address racial disparities in sentencing. Every case is different. It should be treated as such, and it will be. Just look at how well it worked in Montana! Rates of criminal activity are dwindling as our society becomes safer.</p>

                    <p>So many people go through the unimaginable horror of having their autonomy forcibly violated every year. Of course, a clogged and often neglected justice system has allowed their kits to stockpile and made it ever so much harder to tangibly investigate their cases. Getting justice for these people is one of the top priorities on our list and will be effected soon after election.</p>
                    <p>Under an Allar Administration the federal government will fully fund the processing of all untested rape kits in the United States, with strict deadlines and public progress tracking. Grants will be allocated to state and local crime labs to hire staff, modernize equipment, and implement best practices for evidence handling. Survivors will have the right to track their case status, and future backlogs will be prevented through ongoing federal oversight.</p>

                    <h3>18. Protecting LGBTQ Youth in Schools</h3>
                    <p>One's sexual orientation is a very important component of their identity, and is their journey to embark on as they begin to figure themselves out. While some Republican politicians would like to force children to cough up facets of their identity that they maybe have not fully integrated into their array of characteristics or come to public terms with yet, for one reason or another, thereby endangering children and making them susceptible from abuse by their hypothetically homophobic parents, Governor Allar remains committed to protecting LGBTQ+ Youth from harm.</p>
                    <p>If elected, Diana Allar's federal government will withhold funding from any public school that requires teachers to disclose a studentâ€™s sexual orientation or gender identity to parents or guardians without the studentâ€™s consent, unless legally required for safety reasons. This protection will safeguard LGBTQ youth, especially those in unsafe or unsupportive home environments, from harm, homelessness, or abuse. While Governor Allar respects a parent's right to be involved in their child's education, no entity has a right to actively endanger a child for any reason they see fit - Moral, religious, or otherwise.</p>

                    <h3>19. Increasing Teacher Pay</h3>
                    <p>While federal wage subsidies and student loan forgiveness are a large step towards ensuring that teachers are fairly compensated and have a larger swath of their financial burden alleviated, there are many more steps to be taken to ameliorate the issue of teachers being chronically underpaid and overworked. One of those steps is an abject, sizable increase of their income.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the federal wage subsidy, we will encourage states to raise base teacher salaries to a competitive national standard of $30 an hour. Federal matching grants will reward states that meet or exceed this threshold, creating healthy competition to retain talent. Our policy acknowledges that competitive pay is not only fair compensation but also a key driver of educational quality. If teachers are expected to be the arbiters of this nation's future, it is imperative they are treated with the respect they deserve.</p>

                    <p>As increasing the national standard of education has proven to be a priority of this campaign, doing so would not be possible without increasing funding for the department of education to tackle existing shortfalls. Whilst many decry the Department of Education as useless, we say that it has a purpose: Enforcing a national standard of education via monetary resourcing and administering education-related federal programs is just as important as many other departments of a similar caliber.</p>
                    <p>Under Allar, the Department of Education will receive expanded funding to support state and local initiatives in early childhood education, special education, literacy, STEM development, and vocational training. Investments will also be directed toward rural schools and underserved urban districts, closing achievement gaps and ensuring equitable access to high-quality education nationwide.</p>

                    <h3>21. Funding Better Literacy Education</h3>
                    <p>For the better part of fifty years, American society has faced an illiteracy problem. Our children are more invested in pop culture and media frenzies than they are their own education, and it is proving to be a problem for the continued strength of the arts, literature, and sciences. Many authors are told by their publishers to mark their writing down to a fifth grade level to make media easier to consume for the masses. I don't think that's right. I think that we need to divert more funds towards ensuring that our children can read, and that they love to read. I have been a reader my entire life. From the time I was a little girl, reading was my fascination. I particularly enjoyed the works of Charles Dickens.</p>
                    <p>It shouldn't be a figment of the past for kids to enjoy authors like Charles Dickens. We should have easier access to literary resources in public schools, fund book drives in underserved areas, construct little libraries across the United States, implement free programs to teach illiterate adults English up to a tenth-grade level, and incentivize the curation of better take-home reading lists in grade schools. These are just a few of the many steps we can take to ensure that our population gets back to reading books and engaging in the Arts.</p>

                    <p>One of the largest shortfalls in the American medical system is the lack of attention paid to the Organ Transplantation system. The neglect of this system has caused excessive wait listing, the improper care of and subsequent failure of multiple donated organs, and the lack of detail paid to interstate coordination of organ transferal.</p>
                    <p>Under an Allar Administration, the U.S. organ donation system will be modernized to expand availability, reduce wait times, and improve fairness. Reforms include streamlining donor registration, creating an opt-out default organ donation system under the framework of the AmeriCare Act, strengthening anti-discrimination rules for transplant eligibility, and improving interstate organ sharing coordination. Additional funding will support public awareness campaigns and medical research into organ preservation and artificial organs.</p>

                    <p>While abortion is a contentious issue, there is zero reason that the federal government should prohibit itself from funding a basic healthcare procedure. Especially coupled with Section 4 of the NH-Budd Welfare Reform Act, which we intend to get rid of, these policies are dangerous and make abortion inequitable for lower-income people who may wish to terminate a pregnancy.</p>
                    <p>The Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for most abortions, will be repealed under Allar to ensure that low-income people and those on Medicaid and AmeriCare have equal access to reproductive healthcare. Abortion will be recognized as a standard medical procedure covered under all federally funded healthcare programs, removing financial barriers and ensuring reproductive rights are fully accessible, regardless of income.</p>

                    <p>Under an Allar Administration, federal law will require states and the Bureau of Prisons to provide parole eligibility to incarcerated individuals aged 65 or older who have served at least 15 years, except in cases of specific ongoing public safety risk. Our policy acknowledges declining recidivism rates with age, reduces prison overcrowding, and reallocates resources to rehabilitation and victim services.</p>

                    <p>If Diana Allar is elected President of the United States, every U.S. resident will have the legal right to change their gender marker on government documents through self-identification, without requiring medical documentation or court orders. This change will apply to all federal identification and will set a standard for states to follow, ensuring that trans and nonbinary individuals can navigate life with documentation that reflects their identity, and that this right is not needlessly infringed by the federal government out of a sense of responsibility to engage with the culture war in a disruptive and rude manner.</p>

                    <p>Under an Allar Administration, work requirements for federal welfare programs, including SNAP, TANF, and Medicaid, will be eliminated. Similarly, income requirements for AmeriCare eligibility that were established under the Dole Administration will be repealed, and AmeriCare will be returned to its intended purpose: A universal, opt-out public health insurance option, as well as a nationally coordinated medical supply chain and federal hospital facility network. Assistance will be based solely on need, not employment status, recognizing that many recipients face barriers such as disability, caregiving responsibilities, or economic downturns. This reform will reduce bureaucratic hurdles, prevent unnecessary loss of benefits, and ensure that welfare programs fulfill their intended role as a safety net.</p>
