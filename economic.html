                    <h3>1. Windfall Tax</h3>
                    <p>It's time to ensure that money isn't being taken right out of your wallet and hoarded by fat cats. Allar will tax corporations for extraordinary, exploitation- or crisis-driven profits and redistribute revenues to fund direct relief for families, public investments, and price-stabilizing programs, particularly in essential industries. This policy targets sectors that unfairly profited from emergency conditions, ensures money is returned to the public, and finances affordability measures like rental assistance, rebates on essential goods, and investments in domestic manufacturing.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>2. Strategic Mineral Reserve Act</h3>
                    <p>Create national stockpiles of critical minerals and raw materials—lithium, cobalt, rare earths—to reduce supply-chain vulnerabilities from government-sanctioned space mining, secure clean-energy supply chains, and support strategic domestic manufacturing. The Reserve would be managed to stabilize prices, coordinate with allies, and incentivize sustainable domestic space mining and recycling. Space mining is a very sensitive and inflationary industry, we must ensure its protection from vulnerabilities.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>3. Requiring compliance with sectoral bargaining in federal contracts</h3>
                    <p>Require companies that win federal contracts to comply with industry-level bargaining agreements or to recognize multi-employer collective bargaining frameworks, ensuring federal dollars support higher standards, predictable wages, and industry-wide protections rather than a race to the bottom.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>4. Hiring halls for displaced workers in states with high unemployment</h3>
                    <p>Establish union-coordinated hiring halls and placement centers in regions hit hard by layoffs, giving displaced workers rapid access to reemployment, apprenticeship placements, retraining programs, and wraparound support to ease transitions between jobs.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>5. Excess profit recapture (Taxing corporations that raise prices faster than wages)</h3>
                    <p>Introduce a tax on firms whose price increases outpace national wage growth, discouraging opportunistic price hikes and recapturing excess income to fund consumer relief, enforcement resources, and worker-support programs.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>6. CEO Pay Ratio Cap of 50:1 for federal contractors and subcontractors</h3>
                    <p>Cap the pay ratio between CEOs and median workers at 50:1 for firms receiving federal dollars, aligning executive compensation with worker pay, discouraging excessive executive pay funded by public contracts, and promoting wage growth across firms serving taxpayers.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>7. Triple NLRB Funding</h3>
                    <p>Provide the National Labor Relations Board with significantly expanded funding to speed investigations, modernize enforcement technology, and reduce case backlogs—so unfair labor practices are addressed rapidly and workers can organize without prolonged delay.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>8. Corporate death penalty for repeat wage-theft violators</h3>
                    <p>Empower regulators to revoke corporate charters or strip firms of business licenses after repeated, egregious wage-theft offenses, removing repeat offenders from the market and converting abandoned assets to worker-run or community-owned enterprises.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>9. Expand monopoly threshold</h3>
                    <p>Tighten antitrust thresholds and update merger review standards to cover modern market realities—platform concentration, common ownership, and data-control—so regulators can block mergers that substantially reduce competition before harm occurs.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>10. Harsher penalties for companies that exploit people abroad for product manufacturing</h3>
                    <p>Increase sanctions, import bans, and criminal penalties for firms complicit in forced labor, child labor, or severe rights abuses abroad; require supply-chain audits and public disclosure so consumers and enforcement agencies can hold violators accountable.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>11. Produce 50+ Active pharmaceutical ingredients domestically by 2058</h3>
                    <p>Launch a long-term industrial policy to reshore essential pharmaceutical production, invest in public and private manufacturing capacity, and guarantee domestic production of at least 50 key active pharmaceutical ingredients to secure medicine supplies and lower drug shortages.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>12. Force divestment of idle patents and real estate</h3>
                    <p>Require firms that hoard patents or leave valuable real estate idle to either commercialize, license, sell, or forfeit those assets—freeing innovation bottlenecks, lowering barriers to competition, and unlocking land for housing and productive use.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>13. Ban vertical integration in food and healthcare</h3>
                    <p>Diana Allar will forbid dominant firms from owning multiple levels of the supply chain in critical sectors like food and healthcare—separating production, distribution, and retail—to prevent price extraction, conflicts of interest, and market foreclosure.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>14. CEOs may be held personally liable for wage theft</h3>
                    <p>Diana Allar will allow civil and, for severe willful abuses, criminal liability for executives who knowingly enable or conceal systemic wage theft—creating stronger deterrents and ensuring accountability reaches decision-makers, not just corporate shells.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>15. Mandate return of bonuses when firms raise prices >2x inflation rate</h3>
                    <p>An Allar Administration will require executive bonus clawbacks when companies knowingly raise prices at rates substantially above general inflation without justified cost drivers; recovered funds would be redistributed to affected consumers and workers.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>16. Increase the Land Value Tax</h3>
                    <p>An Allar Administration will implement a progressive land value tax to capture economic rents from landowners, incentivize productive use of land, and generate revenue for public goods, addressing wealth inequality and funding essential services.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>17. Criminal penalties for algorithmic price-fixing</h3>
                    <p>Make it a crime to deploy algorithms, collusive pricing bots, or coordinated machine-learning systems that automate price-fixing or tacit collusion across competitors, with penalties for firms and responsible managers.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>18. Expand AmeriCare Act model to housing (FedHomes) and utilities</h3>
                    <p>Extend the public-option model to essential services by creating FedHomes as a public housing option and regulated public utilities that provide affordable, transparent rates—leveraging scale to lower costs and guarantee basic services for all.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>19. Mandate public cost breakdowns for essential goods</h3>
                    <p>Require sellers of essential goods to publish standardized cost breakdowns—materials, labor, distribution, and margin—so policymakers, regulators, and consumers can see where prices come from and spot unjustified markups.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>20. 25% bounty on recovered price-fixing fines</h3>
                    <p>Offer whistleblowers and cooperating state/federal attorneys a 25% bounty on fines recovered from price-fixing cases to incentivize tip-offs, speed enforcement, and increase the resources available for antitrust investigations.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>21. Limit student debt payments to 5% of disposable income</h3>
                    <p>Legislate a permanent cap that limits monthly student loan payments to 5% of disposable income to make repayment affordable, reduce defaults, and stabilize household balance sheets—paired with income-driven adjustments for hardship.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>22. Forgiveness after 10 years of student debt payments (5 years for public service)</h3>
                    <p>Guarantee widespread loan forgiveness after 10 years of compliant payments, and accelerate forgiveness to 5 years for public-service careers—rewarding socially valuable work and lowering long-term burdens.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>23. National 15% interest rate cap</h3>
                    <p>Establish a uniform usury cap of 15% APR on consumer credit products nationwide to protect borrowers from predatory rates while preserving access to responsible lending and encouraging lower-cost public alternatives.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>24. Ban junk fees on mortgages/rental applications</h3>
                    <p>Prohibit hidden and excessive application fees in housing finance and rental markets, requiring transparent, reasonable charges only; this reduces housing access barriers and prevents exploitative gatekeeping costs.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>25. 3% emergency loans during inflationary spikes</h3>
                    <p>Provide emergency, low-cost 3% loans through public banking channels during defined inflation spikes to help households bridge short-term price pressures without resorting to high-interest payday alternatives.</p>

                    <p>Protect workers who withhold payments from creditors or collectors engaged in clear fraud or illegal activity—shielding them from retaliation and creating legal pathways to contest abusive claims.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="issue-card">

                    <p>Strengthen class-action tools, statutory damages, and collective enforcement mechanisms so communities can efficiently pursue redress against predatory lenders and share recovered relief across harmed borrowers.</p>
